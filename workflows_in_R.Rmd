In this section, we are going to be discussing some general "workflows" that you may find helpful in organizing your research. Here we will discuss a few topics, including:

* RStudio Projects
* Common issues
* Working file structure i/o
* Git/GitHub




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# RStudio Project

Projects are a great way to organize your workflow. When you create a project, it is saved within a directory (either new or existing) that helps organize related files and scripts. Opening a project sets the working directory to that designated space, making it easier to share project directories with others. Thereâ€™s additional added benefits:

* you don't have to set the working directory
* you can set preferences for that environment
* saving history specific to that project
* auto-saves within project directory
