In this section, we are going to be discussing some general "workflows" that you may find helpful in organizing your research. Here we will discuss a few topics, including:

* RStudio Projects
* Working file structure and data input/output
* Git/GitHub



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# RStudio Project

Projects are a great way to organize your workflow. When you create a project, it is saved within a directory (either new or existing) that helps organize related files and scripts. Opening a project sets the working directory to that designated space, making it easier to share project directories with others. Thereâ€™s additional added benefits:

* you don't have to set the working directory
* you can set preferences for that environment
* saving history specific to that project
* auto-saves within project directory

## Starting fresh
When working with data, in your code you must set the directory paths in order to access data and save data, scripts, and documentation. 

This can be done with the `setwd()` command and a typical script might begin looing something like this:

```{r setwd, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# set directory
setwd("~/Google Drive/Teaching/PSY_607_data_science/2019s/mycode/")

# clear global environment
rm(list = ls())

```

However, there two problems here. 

1. The `setwd()` is idiosyncratic to my computer and not helpful to other sharing in on the project. 
2. The `rm(list = ls())` is considered bad form and may not actually do what you want it to.

(See [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for detailed discussion.)

## Create a new project
Instead let's start with a project.

Using a project will set all analyses and code with the working directory as the project directory. This makes it easy to keep everything together and access your code and data.
